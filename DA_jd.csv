How We Work

Freedom and Flexibility: At Loom, we believe work is an act, not a place. When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. If you are in the Bay Area, you can drop by our San Francisco office on 2nd and Market St. We are able to hire across the United States and Canada and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation.

Engaging Workday: The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this ‘sync time’ is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.

Work-Rest Balance: The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is a natural part of the workday.

Social Connection: Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Loommates are able to meet in person with their teams at least twice a year purely for fun. We have also built local offices for those who want to work or meet in person, starting with San Francisco and New York City.

How We Work

Freedom and Flexibility: At Loom, we believe work is an act, not a place. When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. If you are in the Bay Area, you can drop by our San Francisco office on 2nd and Market St. We are able to hire across the United States and Canada and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation.

Engaging Workday: The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this ‘sync time’ is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.

Work-Rest Balance: The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is a natural part of the workday.

Social Connection: Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Loommates are able to meet in person with their teams at least twice a year purely for fun. We have also built local offices for those who want to work or meet in person, starting with San Francisco and New York City.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

264,Data Analyst,OnFrontiers,"New York, NY","OnFrontiers is tackling a problem shared by every institution, company, and team: knowledge is trapped; organizations can't unlock it fast enough or capture and learn from it to improve over time. As a consequence, their growth and impact fall far short of potential. OnFrontiers exists to solve that problem. We make organizations smarter, on-demand.

We believe tomorrow's most innovative organizations won't be composed of static org charts with rigid boundaries; they will be more amorphous, supported by a cloud of at-the-ready specialists, on-demand advisors, and a proprietary stable of experts. These organizations will use OnFrontiers tools and the power of networks to access, harness, and distribute expertise within and outside their organization. We're building an entirely new technology category - a platform and set of applications that fundamentally change how organizations tap into their most valuable resource: knowledge.

Our team is motivated by the drive to fundamentally rethink how organizations operate. This isn't an academic exercise - we convert our concepts into user-friendly, enterprise-grade tools, and ship those tools to market as quickly as possible. On the back of strong growth in 2020, and with COVID-19 significantly accelerating our trajectory, OnFrontiers is hiring across every function. In the coming months, we'll be making significant enhancements and major expansions in functionality to our flagship product, and build an entirely new product suite, while dramatically expanding our customer base and expert community.

We're hiring a Data Analyst to help us scale our expert network growth by creating demand within target audiences and understanding how we can improve operational efficiencies. Our Data Analyst will initially help set the foundation for the operations function at OnFrontiers contributing to key decisions about tools, metrics, strategic roadmap and experiments. As we carve out our place in the market, you'll help determine how to structure our data lake and will help establish our BI toolkit to increase organizational performance.

In this remote (US based) role, you'll:
Help set-up an organization wide data lake with information from both our expert-focused and organization-focused datasets
Mine and analyze internal data to build an in-depth understanding of our users, and blend this analysis with third party research results
Enhance data collection procedures to include information that is relevant for building analytic systems
Process, clean, and verify the integrity of data used for analysis
Create automated anomaly detection systems and constant tracking of its performance
Work closely with cross-functional partners (i.e., marketing, product, sales) to address knowledge gaps in our understanding of users and their behavior
Leverage syndicated third party research services to compile, synthesize, and turn-around rapid insights collateral to meet inbound requests
Adapt analysis to the specific research questions using a range of data sources and research methodologies
Communicate results and business recommendations to diverse business stakeholders

We're looking for people who bring:
At least 2-3 years relevant work experience in data analytics or data science
Relevant bachelor's degree in a business field with a focus on quantitative or research methods; graduate degree in a science, mathematics, operations, business, digital marketing or survey-based research methods is a plus
Experience with common data science toolkits (e.g., R, Weka, NumPy, MatLab, etc.)
Proficiency in using query languages (e.g., SQL)
Experience with data visualization tools (e.g., D3.js, GGplot, etc.)
Experience with NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase) is a plus
Experience with large datasets and Hive is a plus
Good applied statistics skills, such as distributions, statistical testing, regression, etc.
Great verbal and written communication skills
Interest in working in a fast paced environment with global talent
Exceptional time and goal-oriented self-management skills are a must
Experience with the federal market or in a business focused on talent or research is a plus

There is more to working at OnFrontiers than your day-to-day responsibilities.
Our culture is inquisitive. We're open-minded, listen to one another, outside experts and real-world customer feedback to further our mission.
We are a remote company. We trust our team members to define and tackle their chosen tasks and expect them to openly communicate the challenges they're facing.
We invest in our team by offering competitive base salaries and equity, medical, dental and vision benefits, and generous time off for eligible employees.
We're committed to your personal development. We fund mentorship from experts on the OnFrontiers platform and reimburse other job-related training expenses.

Data analysis is at the forefront of ESIS business strategy. The organization recognizes that organizing, querying, visualizing, and drawing meaning from data – in step with modern technology - are imperative to generating industry, organizational, and client-specific insights. The Strategic Outcomes & Data Analytics team is charged with generating insights from the book of business to drive meaningful client outcomes.

Responsibility

This role will lead analytic efforts, reporting tools, and interactive visual solutions through the design, prototyping, planning, and delivery phases. This resident role in the Strategic Outcomes business team will support the team’s client-facing staff (directly) while enabling larger data assets in support of the enterprise.

To be effective, the candidate must be comfortable rapidly assessing and then articulating the organizational, procedural, and functional use of data elements. While the Strategic Outcomes team will provide business context in exchange for this role’s technical skill, this position will serve as a product owner in multiple technology-driven settings. This requires the successful candidate to frame business needs against current- and proposed-state technologies.

Engaging Workday: The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this ‘sync time’ is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.

We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is a natural part of the workday.

Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities.

How We Work

Freedom and Flexibility: At Loom, we believe work is an act, not a place. When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. If you are in the Bay Area, you can drop by our San Francisco office on 2nd and Market St. We are able to hire across the United States and Canada and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation.

Engaging Workday: The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this ‘sync time’ is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.

Work-Rest Balance: The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is a natural part of the workday.

Social Connection: Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Loommates are able to meet in person with their teams at least twice a year purely for fun. We have also built local offices for those who want to work or meet in person, starting with San Francisco and New York City.

Perks at Loom
Competitive compensation and equity package
99% company paid medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees and dependents (for US employees)
Flexible Spending Account (FSA) and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA)
Healthcare reimbursement (for International employees)
Life, AD&D, Short and Long Term Disability Insurance
401(k) with 4% company matching
Professional development reimbursement
Wellness stipends
Unlimited PTO
Paid parental leave
Remote work opportunities
Home office & technology reimbursement
Loom = Equal Opportunity Employer

We are actively seeking to create a diverse work environment because teams are stronger with different perspectives and experiences.

We value a diverse workplace and encourage women, people of color, LGBTQIA individuals, people with disabilities, members of ethnic minorities, foreign-born residents, older members of society, and others from minority groups and diverse backgrounds to apply.
