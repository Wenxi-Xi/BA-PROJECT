The Data Scientist demonstrates an expanded breadth of knowledge and the ability to handle basic issues independently. The incumbent demonstrates very good communication skills; above average planning and organization, teamwork, and decision-making skills; a strong concern for customers; and has basic knowledge of Caterpillar Inc., and its products and services.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

Data Science at Acre

Who we are
Acre is a venture-backed real estate technology company on a mission to create the best way to experience homeownership. Acre’s founders are seasoned entrepreneurs who believe that ownership matters and that buying a home need not be the biggest financial decision of your life. Acre’s model empowers people to buy high quality homes in great neighborhoods, share in the upside of ownership, and care for the home at a lower cost -- all without any debt.

Who you are
You are driven, entrepreneurial, and excited about having a pivotal role in shaping Acre's research, strategy, and operations using data-driven findings and models. You like to think about data optimization, market analysis, product performance, operating efficiency, and tools that help you and your team consistently raise the bar. You know how to maintain a high standard of excellence for yourself and for those around you -- including third party service providers. You are comfortable taking the initiative to examine and explore datasets and creating actionable insights for the rest of the team and company. You want to help build a world-class real estate technology company.

About the role
Acre's goal is to remake the end-to-end homeownership experience. As we craft the product from a consumer-centric perspective and seek to create a strong value proposition to Acre Residents, we must also translate our offerings into an investable portfolio that will be attractive to institutional investors. In service of these efforts, we are hiring our first Data Scientist to build and optimize Acre’s use of data across the entire organization, from operational efficiency to real estate market selection. This role will report to the Head of Investments and work closely with the Portfolio Management and Operations teams. In this role you will:

Work with members of the Investment Management and Operations teams to derive insights into improving Acre’s operational efficiency and investor returns
Build models to forecast real estate portfolio performance (e.g., home price appreciation, rental performance, risk). You will have access to our massive dataset of US home attributes and transactions, and will be expected to blend in new and insightful data.
Support the market and asset selection process through historical data analysis and forecast modeling, and assist with formalizing conclusions into presentations that share our offering with investors and lenders
Conduct exploratory research into single-family residential real estate markets and trends, with a focus on creating actionable ideas and theses that can be incorporated in Acre’s investment management strategy
Work with Asset Management to develop new operational strategies for the Acre portfolio, ranging from optimization of contract terms to strategic dispositions to renovation and capital improvements
Introduce best-in-class data research toolsets and practices
Support client material creation as needed for due diligence, final meetings and reviews

What we're looking for
Have an undergraduate and advanced degree in Statistics, Data Science, Financial Engineering, Operations Research or a related field.
1-3 years of professional experience conducting research or statistical analysis on real-world data, and translating that work into actionable conclusions (real estate experience a plus)
Proficiency in Python, SQL AWS, and/or Spark highly preferred
Comfortable working in an environment with a high degree of autonomy
Keen analytical mindset, strong quantitative educational background, and comfortable working with large datasets
Strong desire to grow an innovative real estate platform

At Acre, we are building an organization where people can do their best work.

We care.
Our enduring objective is to deliver amazing experiences for our customers, teammates, and partners. We start every new endeavor with this objective in mind and operate with excellence at all times to achieve it.

We value ownership.
We empower our customers, teammates, and partners to embrace the pride and responsibility of ownership. We build trust by setting a high bar for performance and following through on our commitments. We find opportunities to continuously improve.

We value teams.
We build teams with diverse perspectives, experience, and capabilities. Our teams share risks, celebrate success together, and build better solutions. We are team players and remain curious about others’ experiences and feedback.

We boldly pursue excellence.
We lean into hard problems that, once solved, will create real value. We establish focus, move quickly, and take risks. We ask “how might we?” instead of “can we?” We ensure that both our successes and the lessons of our failures lead to better outcomes for our customers and teams.

We value the truth.
We are interested in clearly understanding and communicating truth, not in appearances or posturing. We empower each other to address issues immediately regardless of who or what caused them. We have hard conversations regularly and are comfortable with disagreement.

We take a long-term perspective.
We are dedicated to the long-term success of our customers, teams, and company. We know the quality of our decisions improves the longer time-horizon we consider. We demonstrate composure and patience, even when facing urgent problems.

We value diversity.
We value and foster diversity, equity, and inclusion as the best means to build the products that our customers want, and it is the right thing to do. This is part of our mission to make home ownership more accessible and delightful. We actively seek diverse perspectives and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status."

Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Key job responsibilities

Categorizing Customer Idiosyncrasies: As we expand to more customers, we are discovering that they use our product in very different ways and that poses issues for our models. Effectively summarizing these differences (for example, X% of customers do Y) would be immensely helpful.

Detecting and Cleaning Up Outliers: We have discovered a number of situations where single outliers have a huge impact on important model parameters. The DS would help us develop mechanisms to clean up these outliers for model consumption.

Deep Diving Customer Issues: Customers have longstanding traditions and trusted formulas for managing their contact centers. When our formulas differ from theirs, we need to deep dive these discrepancies and determine if there is an issue with our model or if we are giving the customer better results than they are used to.

Assessing Data Gaps: It's hard to estimate the weather in Seattle if the only data you have is the average weight of elephants in Zimbabwe. We know we don't have all the data we need, but we need to answer two related questions: (a) what features can we derive in creative ways from existing data sources? (b) can we estimate the benefit of getting a new data stream in terms of accuracy improvement?

A day in the life

Our team uses agile project management, so the DS calls in to our daily stand-up meeting in the morning to report status and explain their tasks for the day. Throughout the day, the DS will work with our product manager to discuss outstanding issues with our customers that require deep dives, work with our scientists to discuss model performance issues, and discuss software deliverables with our SDEs such as automation of data ingestion to save DS time, deployment of models, etc.

About The Team

Our team is called Eliza and it was founded in 2019 to expedite science adoption in Connect. We are a team of scientists and engineers working on multiple science projects for Amazon Connect. Our team members work closely together to explore different approaches that can simplify management of contact centers and delight our customers and we move fast to implement solutions and refine them based on customer feedback.
